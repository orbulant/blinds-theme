# Change Log

## Version 8.0.0

The `Blinds (Light)` theme is added back in and it now is just the default theme with the semantic/token highlighting changed to the colourblind defaults but not the UI. Similar to the light theme, a new `Blinds (Dark - Editor only)` is added in just for semantic/token highlighting theme change but not the UI.

1. Why were these versions added in?
   1. Because VSCode is changing quite rapidly, i don't have time to fully support the UI changes every update to make sure it looks good, from time to time I will update this theme using the latest and greatest VSCode theme added with the custom colourblind semantic/tokeb highlighting

## Version 7.1.0

The `Blinds (Light)` version has been removed because it's too hurtful for the eyes i feel. I've added a solarized version now as this feels better. If the community wants
a pure light theme, I will add in one again that looks better.

The `Blinds (Default Dark)` has its status bar follow the same colour as the title bar, activity bar and tabs bar to make it consistent. Some polishes are done here and there.

The themes are now both updated to support latest configs from VSCode version 1.93.0 and above (before any breaking changes occur).

## Version 6.0.0 - 7.0.0

Many iterations were tried out for the light theme. Some polishes were made. In version 7.1.0 onwards, i've decided to not use a pure light theme.

## Version 5.2.0

This is hopefully the final version of the theme. The darker variant is removed as it makes no sense to have a default one that is too close to it.

Both the light and dark variant now should be complete.
